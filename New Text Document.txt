Hey there,

So I made the menu for the user study.

The goal is to track the user's preferances and stats, it then sends an emailed text document of the stats to the gamestatemail account
I struggled to open the games in Linux because I dont have the linux partition. 
But I can open them in windows.

What we need from you is to:
Run a command on the linux terminal to run the games

Go to the script.cs file in the Assets/Scripts folder
